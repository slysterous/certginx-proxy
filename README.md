# certginx-proxy
An Nginx reverse proxy implementation with A+ auto-renewed certbot certificates. A host/proxy suitable to be a playground.

## About 

## Motivation
At some point i got a sweet new VPS that cost me less than 10$/month. Then I thought I could have something like a reverse proxy that could just move traffic through many containers that live on the VPS and have some letsencrypt ssl certificates that could ideally renew themselves. Using that i could host any projects on there while having some basic security and have a nice playground to have fun in.
